## Background

Over 1,900 Government websites have search bars run through the Search.gov platform. As part of these efforts, it is important that a certain level of security is kept and maintained. The tools provided by the Elastic X-Pack allow for the Search.gov team to meet those security needs. As a result, the Government is seeking sources who can provide this product or an alternate product that meets these functional capabilities and services:    

* Security
* Alerting
* Monitoring
* Reporting
* Graphing / Visualizations
* Machine Learning
* Elasticsearch technical support

## Background

General Services Administration’s (GSA) Office of Products and Programs (OPP) is the sponsoring organization for Search.gov. For 15 years, Search.gov has transformed the public’s search experience and saved Government agencies valuable resources and money by providing site search services for Government websites.

The Search.gov application powers the search box on thousands of federal government websites, including:
* NASA.gov
* SSA.gov
* USCIS.gov

The Search.gov application uses Elastic’s technology stack, including Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. As a result of the use of this technical infrastructure and the need for application security, monitoring, and reporting, Search.gov requires a subscription for Elastic’s other complementary products, available through the X-Pack  Platinum subscription. Additionally, Search.gov will require access to technical support services available through these subscriptions.

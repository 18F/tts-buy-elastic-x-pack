## 2.0 Background

General Services Administration’s (GSA) Office of Products and Programs (OPP) is the sponsoring organization for Search.gov.

The Search.gov application powers the search box on thousands of federal government websites, including:

-   NASA.gov

-   SSA.gov

-   USCIS.gov

The Search.gov application uses Elastic’s technology stack, including Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. As a result of the use of this technical infrastructure and the need for application security, monitoring, and reporting, Search.gov requires a subscription for Elastic’s other complementary products, available through the X-Pack Platinum subscription. Additionally, Search.gov will require access to technical support services available through these subscriptions.
